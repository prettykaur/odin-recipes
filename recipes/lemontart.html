    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Enjoy this classic Italian tart al limone in the summer and the winter. Easy to make and a crowd-pleaser for dessert. Be sure to give yourself about 4 hours to make. Serves 8.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Finely grated zest & juice of 4 lemons (about 1 cup - 250ml of juice)</li>
            <li>1 cup (220g) caster sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (185ml) pure (thin) cream</li>
            <li>4 eggs, plus 3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 2/3 cups (250g) plain flour</li>
            <li>70g pure icing sugar, sifted</li>
            <li>125g unsalted butter, chilled, chopped</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the pastry, place flour, icing sugar, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Add butter and rub into flour with your fingertips to form a fine crumb. Add yolks and 2 tbsp iced water, knead gently on a lightly floured surface and flatten into a disc. Enclose in plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours. Roll out pastry between 2 sheets of floured baking paper to 3mm thick. Use pastry to line the base and side of a 22cm loose-based fluted tart pan, trimming excess. Chill for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C. Place baking paper and baking weights over chilled pastry, then place on a baking tray. Bake for 25 minutes or until pastry is light golden, then remove weights and paper and bake for a further 15 minutes or until golden and dry. Set aside to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 140°C.</li>
            <li>Combine lemon zest, juice, sugar, cream, eggs, and yolks in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Using a wooden spoon, stir constantly for 6-8 minutes until the mixture reaches 70°C on a kitchen thermometer or coats the back of the spoon like a thin custard. Strain through a fine sieve, discarding solids, and cool to room temperature. Pour cooled lemon mixture into baked tart shell and bake for 35-40 minutes until set with a slight wobble in the centre. Cool to room temperature, then chill for at least 2 hours to set before serving.</li>
