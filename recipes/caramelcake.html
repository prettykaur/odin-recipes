    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 sheets puff pastry</li>
            <li>4 titanium-strength gelatine leaves</li>
            <li>600ml thickened cream</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (55g) caster sugar</li>
            <li>250g dulce le leche or caramel spread</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (75g) flaked almonds, roasted</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Grease a 20cm square cake pan and line with baking paper, leaving some overhanging (this will make the cake easier to remove).</li>
            <li>Lay the pastry sheets on a large baking tray lined with baking paper (alternatively, use 2 trays and swap trays during baking). Prick the pastry with a fork. Cover with baking paper and place another baking tray on top to weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes or until pale golden. Remove the top baking tray and baking paper, then bake for a further 10-15 minutes or until golden. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Soak gelatine in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes to soften. Squeeze excess water from gelatine, then add the leaves to 1/4 cup (60ml) hot water. Stir until melted and combined, then set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Using an electric mixer, whisk cream, vanilla, and caster sugar in a bowl until thick. Stir in the dissolved gelatine.</li>
            <li>Cut the pastry sheets to fit the cake pan. Place 1 pastry square in the pan top with the cream filling. Place the second pastry square over the filling.</li>
            <li>Dot the dulce de leche, then, using a palette knife, spread evenly and sprinkle with flaked almonds. Chill for at least 4 hours or until the filling has set.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove cake from the pan. Slice into pieces and serve.</li>
        </ol>
